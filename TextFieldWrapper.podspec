Limit character input in TextField, trim string when character limit exit, get the character change event, validate inputed character range, modify placeholder color and font, all these functionality you will get with this Wrapper.
Also you will have eye catchy Zoom In/Out focus animation while editing and end of editing SMTextField. All you have to do is:
yourTextField.zoomScale = 1.4 // some value > 1
yourTextField.addBlurToView = self.view // In which view you want to add transparent blur effect.

This wrapper also gives you SMHoshiTextField which have the same effect of HoshiTextField form TextFieldEffects by RaÃºl Riera. It also has all the funtionality of SMTextField.
